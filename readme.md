# Directions for setting up GitPod

Before following these directions,
you will need to sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
if you don't have one already.
This will be useful throughout the rest of your career at Brown CS.
We strongly recommend picking a professional and identifiable username.
For example, I'm [robertylewis](https://github.com/robertylewis).

* Click on [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/robertylewis/leanclass).
  * This will send you to Gitpod. 
* To be continued.
