# Directions for setting up GitPod

Before following these directions,
you will need to sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
if you don't have one already.
This will be useful throughout the rest of your career at Brown CS.
We strongly recommend picking a professional and identifiable username.
For example, I'm [robertylewis](https://github.com/robertylewis).

* Click on [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/robertylewis/leanclass).
  * This will send you to Gitpod.
    Log in with your GitHub account.
* It will take a minute, but eventually,
  you'll see a VSCode interface in your browser.
  You should see:
  * A panel `Terminal` on the bottom.
    There will be some code running here at first.
    Let it finish before you do anything else;
    it's done when the last line is
    `gitpod /workspace/leanclass (master) $`.
  * A panel `Explorer` on the left that lets you browse directories and files.
  * A panel in the middle where files can be opened.
  * A panel on the right, `Lean Infoview`.
