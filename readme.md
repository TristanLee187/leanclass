# Directions for setting up GitPod

Before following these directions,
you will need to sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
if you don't have one already.
This will be useful throughout the rest of your career at Brown CS.
We strongly recommend picking a professional and identifiable username.
For example, I'm [robertylewis](https://github.com/robertylewis).

* Click on [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/robertylewis/leanclass).
  * This will send you to Gitpod.
    Log in with your GitHub account.
* It will take a minute, but eventually,
  you'll see a VSCode interface in your browser.
  You should see:
  * A panel `Terminal` on the bottom.
    There will be some code running here at first.
    Let it finish before you do anything else;
    it's done when the last line is
    `gitpod /workspace/leanclass (master) $`.
  * A panel `Explorer` on the left that lets you browse directories and files.
  * A text editor panel in the middle.
  * A panel on the right, `Lean Infoview`.
* Go back to the [Gitpod home page](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). 
  You'll see your new workspace there.
  Use the dropdown menu â‹® to:
  * Rename the workspace to something recognizable, like "Brown CS0220 Class Repository."
  * Pin the workspace. This is important: 
    if you don't pin it and go two weeks without opening it, Gitpod will delete it!

You're all set up.
In the future, you should bookmark your workspace URL and access it that way,
or use the Gitpod home page. 
The link above will create a new workspace each time you click it.
(This is why we recommend renaming your main workspace, to distinguish it from new ones.)

If at any point your workspace becomes unusable
and you think you need a fresh start,
you can click on the original link to get a new copy of the course workspace.
